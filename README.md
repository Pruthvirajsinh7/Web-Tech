# Web Tech Repository

Welcome to the Web Tech repository! This repository contains various experiments and projects related to web technologies. Below, you'll find information about the contents of this repository.

## Experiments

### Experiment 2 - Resume

In the `exp2` folder, you will find an HTML file named `resume.html`. This HTML file represents a basic resume page. It includes sections for personal information, education, skills, projects, hobbies, and language proficiency.

### Experiment 3 - Frame-based Navigation

The `exp3` folder contains an HTML file `exp3.html` that demonstrates a frame-based navigation system. It divides the page into two frames: a navigation frame and a details frame. Clicking on chapters in the navigation frame scrolls the details frame to the corresponding chapter.

### Experiment 3 - Indian Map Interaction

In the `exp3` folder, there is a subfolder named `indian_map` that contains an HTML file `exp32.html`. This interactive map of India allows you to click on states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, opening full images of these states in new tabs.

### Experiment 4 - Complex Tables and Forms

Inside the `exp4` folder, you'll find two subfolders:

#### Complex Tables

- `complex_table.html`: This HTML file explores various table structures and features, including merged cells, lists, images, and nested tables.

#### Forms

- `form.html` and `form2.html`: These HTML files demonstrate the creation of web forms. They showcase different form elements such as text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploads, and more.

### Experiment 5 - CSS Styles

In the `Exp5` folder, there are two files:

- `FontAndImage.css`: This CSS file defines various styles for fonts, images, and backgrounds.
- `main.html`: An HTML file that uses the `FontAndImage.css` stylesheet to apply the defined styles. It includes sample text and images to showcase these styles.

### Experiment 6 - Styled Tables

In the Exp6 folder, you'll find an HTML file `Exp6.html` and a CSS file `styles.css`. This experiment demonstrates styled tables with different border types (dotted, dashed, groove) and corresponding CSS styles.

### Experiment 7 - CSS

In the `Exp7` folder, there is an HTML file `Exp7.html` that showcases a fun use of CSS, including rotations and transformations, on an image.

### Experiment 8 - Reverse and Combine Digits

In the `Exp8` folder, you'll find two subfolders:

#### Exp81 - Reverse Integer

- Exp81.html: This HTML file prompts the user to enter an integer and displays its reverse.

#### Exp82 - Combine Digits

- `Exp82.html`: This HTML file prompts the user to enter individual digits, combines them, and displays the resulting decimal integer.

### Experiment 9 - Number Humanizer

In the `Exp9` folder, you'll find three subfolders:

#### Exp91 - Combine Arrays

- `Exp91.html`: This HTML file combines two arrays without repeating any numbers.

#### Exp92 - Humanize Number

- `Exp92.html` and `Exp92.js`: This experiment humanizes a number (e.g., 3rd, 21st) based on user input.

### Exp93 - Library Website

- This folder contains files for a library website where users can log in, view books, and place orders.

### Experiment 10 - JSON Data Fetching

In the Exp10 folder, you'll find three files:

- `data.json`: Contains sample JSON data.
- `Exp10.html`: This HTML file includes a script (`script.js`) to fetch and display data from `data.json`.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for fetching and displaying JSON data.
## Usage

You can explore and run these experiments by opening the respective HTML files in your web browser. Feel free to modify and adapt them as needed for your own web development projects.


Happy coding!
